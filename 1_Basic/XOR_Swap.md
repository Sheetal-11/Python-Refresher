The **XOR (`^`) operator** is a **bitwise operation** that swaps two numbers without using extra memory.

### **1️⃣ Understanding XOR (`^`)**
- **XOR Rule**: `A ^ B` gives **1 if bits are different** and **0 if bits are the same**.  
- **Example:**
  ```
  5  →  0 1 0 1  (Binary)
  10 →  1 0 1 0  (Binary)
  ----------------
  5 ^ 10 = 1 1 1 1  (Binary) = 15 (Decimal)
  ```

---

```python
a = a ^ b  
b = a ^ b  
a = a ^ b  
```
### **2️⃣ Step-by-Step XOR Swapping**
Let's swap `a = 5` and `b = 6` using XOR:

#### **Step 1: Compute `a = a ^ b`**
```python
a = a ^ b
```
- Binary representation:
  ```
  a = 5   →  0 1 0 1
  b = 6  →   0 1 1 0
  ------------------
  a = 3  →  0 0 1 1
  ```
  
---

#### **Step 2: Compute `b = a ^ b` (New `a`, old `b`)**
```python
b = a ^ b
```
- Binary representation:
  ```
  a = 3  →  0 0 1 1
  b = 6  →  0 1 1 0
  ------------------
  b = 5   →  0 1 0 1
  ```
💡 Now, `b` becomes `5` (the original value of `a`).


#### **Step 3: Compute `a = a ^ b` (New `a`, new `b`)**
```python
a = a ^ b
```
- Binary representation:
  ```
  a = 3  →   0 0 1 1
  b = 5   →  0 1 0 1
  ------------------
  a = 6  →   0 1 1 0
  ```
💡 Now, `a` becomes `6` (the original value of `b`).


🚀 **Final Result:**
```python
print("After swapping: a =", a, ", b =", b)
```
✔ **`a = 6`, `b = 5`** (successfully swapped!)

### **Why Does XOR Swapping Work?**
1. `a = a ^ b` stores **combined** information of `a` and `b`.  
2. `b = a ^ b` cancels out `b` and leaves the original `a`.  
3. `a = a ^ b` cancels out `a` and leaves the original `b`.  

💡 **Key Benefit:** It swaps values **without using extra memory** or temporary variables.

### **When to Use XOR Swapping?**
✅ **When memory is a concern** (e.g., embedded systems).  
✅ **When working with bitwise operations** in low-level programming.    
✅ It works for **any two distinct numbers** (except when swapping a number with itself, which makes it zero).   
✅ **Key Rule:** `a = a ^ b`, `b = a ^ b`, `a = a ^ b` always swaps values correctly.

🚫 **When not to use XOR?**  
- It’s **harder to understand** than `a, b = b, a`.  
- It **doesn’t work well with floating-point numbers**.
